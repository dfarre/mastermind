Title: New Game
Story: |-
  As a codebreaker
  I want to start a new Mastermind game of B boards of G guesses
  In order to play
Scenarios:
  Even boards:
  - When I request a new `game` of "2" boards of "3" guesses
  - Then a game of "2" boards of "3" guesses and me as the codebreaker is created
  Odd boards:
  - When I request a new `game` of "9" boards of "12" guesses
  - Then I get a 400 response saying it must be even
