Title: Clear Board
Story: |-
  As a codebreaker
  I want a clear board with a new code
  In order to start making guesses on it
Scenarios:
  A new board:
  - When I request a clear `board` in my game
  - Then the next board is added to the game
  An unfinished board:
  - Given my new game
  - And a new board
  - And I post two guesses
  - When I request a clear `board` in my game
  - Then I get a 400 response with the board number and guesses left
  Clear board "x" i am not the codebreaker:
  - When I request a clear `board` in a game of another user
  - Then I get a 400 response saying it is not my game
  Game is over:
  - Given an unfinished board
  - And I fill the board and try another guess
  - And a new board
  - And I guess the code and try another guess
  - When I request a clear `board` in my game
  - Then I get a 400 response with the final rankings
