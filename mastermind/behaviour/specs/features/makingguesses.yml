Title: Making Guesses
Story: |-
  As a codebreaker
  I want to get the correct feedback and scores when I post a guess
  So that I can play on the board as game rules are followed
Scenarios:
  I fill the board and try another guess:
  - When I post a `guess` with code "BYOY"
  - And I post a `guess` with code "BYGY"
  - Then the guess "-2" is added with feedback "FFF"
  - And I get a 400 response from guess "-1" saying the board is full
  - And my score is "5" against "4"
  I guess the code and try another guess:
  - When I post a `guess` with code "BYGY"
  - And I post a `guess` with code "RBGG"
  - Then the guess "-2" is added with feedback "FFFF"
  - And I get a 400 response from guess "-1" saying I already guessed the code
  - And my score is "9" against "5"
  I post two guesses:
  - When I post a `guess` with code "YBYR"
  - And I post a `guess` with code "PYBY"
  - Then the guess "-2" is added with feedback "CCC"
  - And the guess "-1" is added with feedback "FFC"
  New game "x" i am not the codebreaker:
  - When I post a `guess` in a game of another user
  - Then I get a 400 response saying it is not my game
